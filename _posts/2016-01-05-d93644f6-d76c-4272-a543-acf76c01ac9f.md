What is the difference between UX and UI?
null

"**User experience (UX) **is delivered through a **user interface (UI)**. User experience is the activity, and user interface is the medium."

**User experience **design focuses on a sequence of actions that happen to a user while they're working with a software product, and makes sure the user achieves their end goal while being happy. 

**Interaction design **focuses more on the behavior aspect of the user experience. The word "interactive" relates to the subject of design: interactive digital products, systems, and services. 

**Usability **evaluates how easy the product is to use---and to learn. 

**Information architecture (IA) **deals with the structure and presentation of information. IA experts typically work with the most complex information systems or products. Common tasks include organization, labeling, search, and navigation. 

**Visual design **defines "the look and feel" of the app. It's the final stage of the UI design process when we're working with a high-fidelity layout or a live app. Visual design deals with colors, typography, icons, and overall aesthetics of the final product.
